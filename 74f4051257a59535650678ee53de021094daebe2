Suggestion: print the correct command line synopsis (\"pouch start \u003cname\u003e \u003c...\u003e\").\n3. https://trello.com/c/uRnqBdRf/36-maman13-14-type-c-hypervisor-userspace-kernel-space-integration - we need a functionality of the first 3 commands (create/limit/start)\n4. $ pouch start c1 --daemonize\nPouch container - cont_c1 starting\n$ pouch start c1 --daemonize\nPouch container - cont_c1 starting\n$ pouch start c1 --daemonize\nPouch container - cont_c1 starting\nCannot find tty\n\nWhat happens at the second/third time the cont_c1 is started?\n\n5. what is the reason for cont_ preffix addition to the container name?\n$ pouch connect cont_c1\nPouch container - cont_cont_c1 connecting\ncannot open cont_cont_c1",

The commands we are going to implement are: start/connect/disconnect/destroy and need to consider if we are going to make limit in the start command or implement another one.\n\n4. Return is now \"\u003ccnt_name\u003e already started\"\n\n5. prefix removed. And message \"There is no container named \u003ccnt_name\u003e in a started stage\", if user tries to connect to an unknown container.",
