/**
 * On-disk inode structure
 * Currently, all the inode data is located inside a single object. We can
 * improve the implementation by implementing an indirect structure as in the
 * original xv6 file system.
 *
 * Inodes object names are "inode" and then the object id as 4 bytes. Because
 * part of the bytes can be zero we must change them so the id won't be cut in
 * the middle. Hence, we set the highest bit on for all the bytes and don't
 * use it to store the id. Hence, each byte contains only 127 possible values
 * and not 255. To make up for the loss, we add another byte to the id.
 For example, "inode5" would be "inode\x85\x80\x80\x80\x80" for uint of size 4
 * bytes.
 *
 * Not like in the original xv6 implementation, here we have no limitation on
 * the amount of inodes and we don't preserve space for them. This is done by
 * the fact the inodes are regular objects.
 * Moreover the `dinode` doesn't contain the inode name becuse it is the name
 * of the object.
