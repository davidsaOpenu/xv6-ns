      "message": "No, it sets the correct compilation flags for debugging targets, so when you call \u0027make qemu-gdb\u0027 it will generate debug-able binaries. For other targets the optimization flag remains -O2.\n\nThe older option for debugging is calling \u0027make debug\u003dtrue qemu-gdb\u0027, which is both redundant - since if you want \u0027qemu-gdb\u0027 it\u0027s clear you also want the debug library, and causes a busy-waiting loop on main(), which I don\u0027t see the reason for, since on debug targets qemu starts in a paused state anyway.\n\nI suggest removing the \u0027debug\u003dtrue\u0027 flag entirely, unless there is a good reason for its busy loop.",

      "message": "debug flag and XV6_WAIT_FOR_DEBUGGER were added as a part of https://review.gerrithub.io/c/davidsaOpenu/xv6-ns/+/458518 and \nseems they are required for visual studio (I have not ability to \ncheck it, though).\n\nline 277 is a duplication of line 107. \n\nLine 107 can be removed, I guess.\n\nAnd probably worth renaming debug to pause_debug in Makefile and \nin windows-debugging-templates/readme.txt to reflect the fact that \nthe flag is used only in cases when debugging is not started in a paused state.",
