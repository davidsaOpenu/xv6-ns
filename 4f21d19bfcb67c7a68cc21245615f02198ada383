      "message": "If i understand correctly when using a command outside the root directory the first exec will fail then the file descriptor is used to check the file is valid, lastly the exec is run a second time with a fixed path (added backslash to the start). \n\nQ: Can\u0027t you just fix the path both for root dir commands and non root commands?\n   This can remove the need for two exec commands?\nQ: Why check a valid fd just to have exec do the same?",
